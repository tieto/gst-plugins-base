Major bugfixes

  buffer pool failed allocation.
- Big GL performance improvement on iOS by a factor of 2 by using Apple's sync
  extension.
- Deadlocks in the DirectSound elements on Windows, and the behaviour of its
  mute property were fixed.
- The Direct3D video sink does not crash anymore when minimizing the window
- The library soname generation on Android >= 6.0 was fixed, which previously
  caused GStreamer to fail to load there.
- File related elements have large-file (>2GB) support on Android now.
- gst-libav was updated to ffmpeg 2.8.3.
- Deserialization of custom events in the GDP depayloader was fixed.

  certain situations.

  improved.
