Release notes for GStreamer Base Plugins 1.7.2

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the second release of the unstable
1.7 release series. The 1.7 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The unstable 1.7 release series
will lead to the stable 1.8 release series in the next weeks. Any newly added
API can still change until that point.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately
during the unstable 1.7 release series.


This module contains a set of reference plugins, base classes for other
plugins, and helper libraries. It also includes essential elements such
as audio and video format converters, and higher-level components like playbin,
decodebin, encodebin, and discoverer.

This module is kept up-to-date together with the core developments.  Element
writers should look at the elements in this module as a reference for
their development.

This module contains elements for, among others:

  device plugins: x(v)imagesink, alsa, v4lsrc, cdparanoia
  containers: ogg
  codecs: vorbis, theora
  text: textoverlay, subparse
  sources: audiotestsrc, videotestsrc, giosrc
  network: tcp
  typefind functions
  audio processing: audioconvert, adder, audiorate, audioresample, volume
  visualisation: libvisual
  video processing: videoconvert, videoscale
  high-level components: playbin, uridecodebin, decodebin, encodebin, discoverer
  libraries: app, audio, fft, pbutils, riff, rtp, rtsp, sdp, tag, video


Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
gst-libav
contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)
